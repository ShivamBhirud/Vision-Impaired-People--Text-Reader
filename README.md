# Vision-Impaired-People--Text-Reader
Random text from document or image reader to help listen to the Vision Impaired people.

I have used Pytesseract module in python to detect text on the given image. Image can be a document scanned copy or a noisy image as shown in sample images. 

Modules Required to install on your system-
1. Pytesseract - to detect the text on image.
2. CV2 - to perform operation on image: to reduce unnecessary noise or for smoothning of image etc. 
3. pyttsx3 - to convert text into audio and call out the text loudly.
